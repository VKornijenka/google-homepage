This is my first project on TOP.
I've done about four projects throught FCC previously, but this one will have a lot less hand holding compared to Free Code Camp. I'm going to try my best to copy the Google homepage. 
It's not going to be able to do anything, but I may try and introduce a separate page for a form, perhaps a "sign in" button that would leave you to a form.
Hopefully I hoping to align the divs properly and make it as similar to the homepage as I can.

I will reflect back on this once I finish the project and see how I went.
