This is my first project on TOP.
I've done about four projects throught FCC previously, but this one will have a lot less hand holding compared to Free Code Camp. I'm going to try my best to copy the Google homepage. 
It's not going to be able to do anything, but I may try and introduce a separate page for a form, perhaps a "sign in" button that would leave you to a form.
Hopefully I hoping to align the divs properly and make it as similar to the homepage as I can.

I will reflect back on this once I finish the project and see how I went.


REFLECTION: 

I have finished it! It was surprisingly difficult. I ran into several roadblocks due to minimal handholding. I realized that I didn't quite know the difference between "margin" and "top" elements. Borders and ":hover" commands proved quite daunting as well. I haven't made a sign in form as I decided to switch to an image instead of a sign in button. However, my stretch goal is to learn how to do a drop down menu upon clicking the little button with the squares. This should give a drop down list of different icons to click. But as of right now I am quite happy how it turned out. Looks very close to the Google homepage!
